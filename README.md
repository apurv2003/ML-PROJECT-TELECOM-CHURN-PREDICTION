Problem Statement
Customer churn has been one of the major challenges looming over the competitive landscape in the industry of telecommunications. The scenario wherein a customer defects to a competitor, thus directly affecting revenue and market share, is called churn. However, very few companies actually do predict this with due consideration and have appropriate mitigation strategies despite the tall claims on improving customer satisfaction. This project will focus on developing a machine learning-based predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning, hence enabling proactive retention strategies.

Objectives
Data Collection: Gather relevant customer data from sources like records of usages, billing information, and customer service interactions.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to guarantee the quality and consistency of the data.
Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features in regard to predicting customer churning.
Model Selection: A selection of different machine learning algorithms suitable for predicting churn, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Model Training: Train all the selected models on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Measure the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or the F1 score.
Model Selection: Select the best model based on the evaluation metrics.
Implementation: Implement the best model into production for predicting customer churning.
To effectively predict telecom churn using a Random Forest model, we will follow a structured approach that encompasses data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment.
